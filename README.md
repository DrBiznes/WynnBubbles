![wynnbubblesbanner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c362b7f7-1966-4c6c-8028-b2dd66cec96e)

Show the people what you're trying to say. Chat floats above your head and changes colors for party, guild, and private chat. A fork of [TalkBubbles](https://modrinth.com/mod/talkbubbles) designed to work specifically with Wynncraft chat. Made for my modpack [World of Wynncraft](https://modrinth.com/modpack/world-of-wynncraft)



## What's Up
- Shows chat bubbles above players' heads when they talk
- Different colors for party, guild, and private messages
- Configurable bubble size, position, and colors
- Removes unwanted unicode symbols from chat
- Stops system messages during raids and dungeons from displaying (as happens using TalkBubbles)

## Installation
1. Make sure you have Fabric Loader and Fabric API installed
2. Download and install Cloth Config API
3. Download the latest version of WynnBubbles from the versions page
4. Place the downloaded .jar file in your Minecraft mods folder

## Future Features
- Custom icons above player head when casting spells that put messages in chat like War Scream, Heal, Windy Feet
- Custom bubble Border styles for different ranks
- Custom icons above player head when picking buffs in a raid
- Suggest features on the GitHub issues page!

## Configuration
You can configure WynnBubbles through the Mod Menu interface or config file:
1. Install [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) if you haven't already
2. In the game, go to Mods -> Find "WynnBubbles" -> Click "Configure"
3. Adjust settings like bubble scale, colors, and chat range
4. Toggle showing your own bubbles on/off

## Usage
- Chat normally in-game to see bubbles appear
- Bubbles will show different colors for:
  - Yellow = Party chat
  - Aqua = Guild chat
  - Orange = Private messages
- Bubbles automatically disappear after a configurable time
- Access the mod's configuration through Mod Menu to adjust bubble appearance

## Requirements
- Minecraft 1.21 or 1.21.1
- Fabric Loader 0.16.5 or higher
- Fabric API
- Cloth Config API
